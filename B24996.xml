            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Thank You heartily for the Bill You have presented Me this day, And I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure you, the Readiness and Chearfulness that has attended the Dispatch of it, is as accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to Me as the Bill it self; After so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a beginning, You may believe I would not Call upon you unnecessarily for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Supply; But when I tell You that the Stores of the Navy and Ordnance are extremely Exhausted, that the Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:196396:2"/> upon several Branches of the Revenue are Great and Burthensome, that the Debts of the KING, My Brother, to His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Family, are such as deserve Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion, That the Rebellion in Scotland, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting more Weight upon it than it really deserves, must Oblige Me to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Expence extraordinary: I am sure such Considerations will move You to give Me an Aid to provide for those Things, wherein the Security, the Ease and the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of My Government are so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; But above all, I must Recommend to You the Care of the Navy, the Strength and Glory of this Nation, That You will put it into such a Condition as may make Us Considered and Respected abroad: I cannot express My Concern upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion more suitable to My own Thoughts of it, than by assuring You I have a true English Heart, as Jealous of the Honour of the Nation as You can be; And I please My Self with the Hopes, that by God's Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and Your Assistance, I may carry the Reputation of it yet Higher in the World
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:196396:3"/> than ever it has been in the Time of any of My Ancestors; And as I will not Call upon you for Supplies, but when they are of Use and Advantage; So I promise you, That what you give Me upon such Occasions, shall be managed with Good Husbandry; And I will take Care it shall be Employed to the Uses for which I ask them.</p>
